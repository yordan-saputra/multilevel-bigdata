        \begin{itemize}
            \item Multilevel models are powerful tools for analyzing hierarchical data structures, allowing for accurate inferences and simultaneous estimation of group and individual effects.
            \item However, large multilevel datasets pose significant computational challenges, including memory constraints and slow estimation times.
            \item The split-sample approach offers a practical solution by partitioning data into manageable subsamples, enabling efficient model fitting while retaining key statistical properties.
            \item R packages like \texttt{lme4} and \texttt{mgcv} provide robust tools for fitting multilevel models, with \texttt{bam()} in \texttt{mgcv} being particularly suited for very large datasets due to its computational efficiency.
            \item Choosing the right approach and tools depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the research questions at hand.
